# Decision-Tree

1. Implement a decision tree to predict housing prices for the given dataset using the
available features.
2. The various attributes of the data are explained in the file data description.txt.
Note that some attributes are categorical while others are continuos.
3. Feel Free to use Python libraries such as binarytree or any other library in Python
to implement the binary tree. However, you cannot use libraries like scikit-learn
which automatically create the decision tree for you.
4. Experiment with different measures for choosing how to split a node(Gini impurity,
information gain, variance reduction) . You could also try different approaches to
decide when to terminate the tree.
5. Report metrics such as Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
along with any other metrics that you feel may be useful.
6. For feature engineering, you may consider normalizing/standardizing the data.
7. Implement simple baselines such as always predicting the mean/median of the training data. Also, compare the performance against scikit-learnâ€™s decision tree. Report
your findings.
